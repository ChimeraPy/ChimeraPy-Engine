ChangeLog and Commit Messages
#############################

To help autogenerate changelogs, we adopted the `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_ standard along with the use of an `auto-generate-changelog <https://github.com/BobAnkh/auto-generate-changelog>`_. By using conventional commits, communication on the progress of ChimeraPy is standardize and linked directly to the code and commits.
