Welcome!
=====================================

We propose the development of ChimeraPy, a distributed computing framework for multimodal data collection. We focus on four key features that are important for multimodal learning analytics purposes: free and open-source code; distributed computing capabilities; the use of python as a programming language; and time-alignment capabilities.
